* [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) --- Covers (almost) everything you need to learn for week 1 of OS class and more, including basic shell commands, scripting, vim, regex, sed, awk, ssh, and git. The first six topics are the most relevant to what we're currently learning in OS class and each topic comes with a 1-hour lecture video, a lecture note, and exercises. This format helps me get a deep understanding of each topic and it's nice that I could just refer back to the lecture notes if I need a refresher on specific tools.

* [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/) --- Interactive regex tutorial. Each regex pattern comes with explanations and a simple exercise. For me, the exercise-based tutorial makes it easier to remember the patterns. Once you finish the tutorials, they also give you practice problems and the solutions.

* [![Virtualization Explained](http://www.img.youtube.com/vi/FZR0rG3HKIk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk) --- A 3-minute YouTube video explaining the concept of virtualization. Helps me to grasp the concept.

* [Cryptographic Right Answers](https://www.latacora.com/blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers/) --- An article explaining the uses of different cryptography tools. Interesting and pretty useful to learn about. 

* [What is a FUSE filesystem?](https://medium.com/@goamaral/fuse-filesystem-b44768f27aa2) --- A short article explaining the overview of FUSE. Helps me to grasp the concept.

* [![you will never ask about pointers again after watching this video](http://www.img.youtube.com/vi/2ybLD6_2gKM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM) --- A 8-minute YouTube video explaining the concept of pointers in C. Helps me to grasp the concept.

[![Pointers in C / C++ [Full Course]](http://www.img.youtube.com/vi/zuegQmMdy8M/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M) --- A 3-hour YouTube video / course on pointers in C and C++. In-depth explanation to help me get a deep understanding on this relatively hard concept.
