* [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) --- Covers (almost) everything you need to learn for week 1 of OS class and more, including basic shell commands, scripting, vim, regex, sed, awk, ssh, and git. The first six topics are the most relevant to what we're currently learning in OS class and each topic comes with a 1-hour lecture video, a lecture note, and exercises. This format helps me get a deep understanding of each topic and it's nice that I could just refer back to the lecture notes if I need a refresher on specific tools.

* [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/) --- Interactive regex tutorial. Each regex pattern comes with explanations and a simple exercise. For me, the exercise-based tutorial makes it easier to remember the patterns. Once you finish the tutorials, they also give you practice problems and the solutions.

* [Virtualization Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk) --- A 3-minute YouTube video explaining the concept of virtualization. Helps me to grasp the concept.
