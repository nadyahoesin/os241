# Tips

* Make sure you have read and understood this week's chapter in the Silberschatz book before taking the quiz.

* Attend the classes (on time)! I didn't realize this at first but your attendance for the current week affects that week's assignment grade.

* If you're struggling with this week's material, look at your classmates' suggested links. A lot of the times, it helps.
